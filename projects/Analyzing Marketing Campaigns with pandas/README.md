# Description

One of the biggest challenges when studying data science technical skills is understanding how those skills and concepts translate into real jobs. Whether you're looking to level up in your marketing job by incorporating Python and pandas or you're trying to get a handle on what kinds of work a data scientist in a marketing organization might do, this course is a great match for you.

We'll practice _translating common business questions into measurable outcomes_, including:

1. **"How did this campaign perform?"**
2. **"Which channel is referring the most subscribers?"**
3. **"Why is a particular channel underperforming?"**
   and more using a fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business.

This course/project will build on Python and pandas fundamentals:

- **merging/slicing datasets**
- **groupby()**
- **correcting data types**
- **visualizing results using matplotlib.**
